**Features**: Free Camera (Works with a controller), FOV Control (Setting values in CE), HUD Toggle, Turn off enemies AI, and many other tweaks.



## Tips and Tricks

* It is extremely recommended set the game as Offline while using CE, otherwise you can risk a softban.

* There is no Camera Tilt and the default FOV is 0.75.

* For the camera script to work, you need to install Stealth Edit 2.4. It is required for the full functions of the CT, the camera script will not work without it. Check the README inside the stealthedit2.4 folder for the setup of this plugin.
