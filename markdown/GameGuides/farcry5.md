## Tools

* [Photomode Improvements (Cheat table) by Skalledit](..\CheatTables\FarCry5_publicRelease_v2.CT)  
**Features**: Photomode range removal, FOV limit removal, tilt support and LOD improvements

## Controls

Key	| Command
--|--
'Numpad +/-' | FOV
'Numpad 1/2' | Tilt

## Cheat Table Workflow

Inject the table in the game, get in the photo mode and enable the first script "Photo mode Limitation".
It will take some time to load up.

Leave it enabled.

Enabling Photo mode Limitation removes the photomode's range limits (this might break shadowing in some areas so you'll 
have to keep an eye out for that). It also removes the FOV and tilt limits.

To improve LOD, just enable the script and leave it enabled.

@alert warning
Try not to Alt-Tab/use Reshade UI while loading up the game or a save, as it can cause freezing even without the CT injected. 
Also, launch Cheat Engine only after you've loaded up a save as it can also cause the game to freeze even without loading up a CT.

This might also cause the game to freeze when restarting after a mission failure/death, so keep saves handy!
