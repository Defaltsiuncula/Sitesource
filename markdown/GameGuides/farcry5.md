@alert Info
Hotsampling works, however the cheat table is required to get rid of the window border/header. Run the game
in windowed mode, enable the 'Enable hotsampling through SRWE' script in the cheat table and you can then 
select whatever resolution you want in SRWE without the game forcing the window border back on the window.
