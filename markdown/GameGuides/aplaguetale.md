## Tips and Tricks

### Customize aspect ratio

For custom aspect ratios, game must be launched in windowed mode. SRWE has to be used to resize the window to the desired aspect ratio.

### Customize engine settings

Go to: `C:\Users\<your user name>\Documents\My Games\A Plague Tale Innocence` 
Open 'ENGINESETTINGS' in notepad. At the bottom change any setting value to 1 = on, or to 0 = off 
For example, change Fringe 1 to Fringe 0, and LensDistortion 1 to LensDistortion 0. 
Do this after the game has been closed, then restart the game
