## Tips and Tricks

Useful console commands: 

TogglePhotoMode
:	Enables the official photo mode for Fallen Order by Respawn.

`r.DepthOfFieldQuality 0` 
:	Disables the vanilla DOF

`r.motionblurquality 0`
:	Disables the motion blur

The console has a history. Simply press arrow-up to get the list of last entered commands. This allows you to quickly switch between 
previously entered commands like r.PostProcessAAQuality 2 etc. It's advisable to use the `PageDown` based timestop provided by the console unlocker as that one works
in cutscenes too.
