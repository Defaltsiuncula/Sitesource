## Console Commands
In order to use console commands, you have to enable the Developer Console first. Start the game, open Settings and then the Keyboard section. Click on Advanced, and in the new window, tick the select box that says Enable Developer Console. By default, the tilde key is used to toggle the console window.

Command | Arguments | Description
--|--|--| 
sv_cheats | 0 / 1 | Enables cheats
hidehud | 0 - 4 | 4 Hides HUD
noclip | 0 / 1 | Toggles noclip (Default key is V)
r_drawviewmodel | 0 / 1 | Toggles viewmodel 
fov | 1 - 100 | Changes field of view

Console commands can be bound to hotkeys with the use of `bind <key> <command>` / `bindToggle <key> <command>` (latter is best for 0 / 1 commands) so the console doesn't have to be opened all the time.

Here's an [in-depth guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170589737) of every console command, though you should be good with the commands already mentioned above.

@alert important
While Reshade works in this game, due to it being a multiplayer title access to the depth buffer will be locked. Use a version of Reshade that has network detection disabled to use depth effects.

## DSR
Changing resolutions too often can cause a game hang, recommended to play at your shooting resolution

## Custom Aspect Ratios
Aspect Ratio might have to be tweaked to see all your custom resolutions
