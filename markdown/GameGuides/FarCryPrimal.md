##HUD Toggle Notes

* Install the contents of the HUD Toggle Zip file to "..\Far Cry Primal\bin". 
* By default the [Numpad_Decimal] key will toggle the game HUD. 

##Reshade Notes

* For access to the depth buffer you will need to set "copy depth buffer before clear" and select the correct depth buffer. The correct depth buffer will need to be selected again when you change the resolution.

##Cheat Table Notes

* The Camera script is enabled with [F1]. This seperates the camera from the character with mouse controlling rotation and the below keys controlling movement.

    Key | Command
	--|--
	Hold Numpad+ 7/9 | FOV
    Numpad 4/6 | X axis
    Numpad 8/5 | y axis
    Numpad 7/9 | z axis

* Timestop script is enabled with [F4]. There are three modes for this, the first time F4 is pressed the time is slowed to almost 0 allowing rotation of the camera with mouse, the second press of F4 completely freezes the game but also stops the ability to rotate the camera. Pressing F4 a third time will resume normal game speed.
Note that this method of time manipulation can cause problems with the game physics resulting in characters, animals and objects floating in the air or slowly moving on their own. It doesn't always happen but if it does can be fixed by reloading a previous saved game.

* Time of Day script is enabled/disabled with [F7]. Use the [[] and []] keys to increase or decrease with [ALT] modifying for larger jumps.

    Key | Command
	--|--
    [ | Decrease time of day
    ] | Increase time of day

* Time of Day Speed script is enabled with [F8]. This can be used to control the flow of time. Bound keys are.

    Key | Command
	--|--
	6 | Reversed
    7 | Paused
    8 | Fast
    9 | Koyaanisqatsi

* I've merged some cheat scripts by Sunbeam into this table. These allow for stealth, god mode [F2], infinite ammo [F3], super speed, super jump and ammo control.
