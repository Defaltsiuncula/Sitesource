## Tips and Tricks

### Get Reshade depth working

Reshade generic depth doesn't work out of the box. To fix it, go to the **Add-ons** tab, and under Generic Depth, filter by the following depth format: `D32S8`

### Enable higher graphics settings

Make sure to head over to **Options** > **Video** and check "**Unlock insane settings**". This will allow you to enable significantly higher graphics settings (at a cost of framerate)

### IGCS Dof settings

In order to get a sharp focus point while using IGCS Dof, make sure to set the frame wait time to Classic (slower) and set the number of frames to wait per frame to around 5, at least 3 will work but 5 just gives a better result.
