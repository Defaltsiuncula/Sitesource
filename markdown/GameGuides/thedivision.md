## Troubleshooting
You should be fine with running both the game and the tools as admin, you might experience some crashes, if you can't get the tools work after several attempts, here are some things you can do:

1. **Start Ubisoft Connect and Steam as admin**.
2. **Start the game as admin directly from the main carpet**. This should be enough, but in case that didn't work:
3. **Load the game and don't inject the tools immediately**, walk around a bit, spend some minutes, then inject the tools.  
**Optional**: You might want to use another injector, you can use ExtremeInjector unless you use Windows 10, it doesn't work with it, though you don't need to change it, the tool's injector works pretty well.
4. **Change your graphics settings**, set them to, let's say, medium or high, if you get the tools working, try changing some setting little by little, remember to reload your game whenever it tells you to do so.

If nothing above worked, which is unlikely, *try restarting your PC* or just *be patient and keep trying*.

@alert important
Use the tools at your own risk! Even though the game hasn't received an update in a long time, there still chance for you to get banned, I'd recommend to not spend much time with the tools on the PvP areas known as Dark Zones.
