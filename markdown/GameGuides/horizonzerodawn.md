## Tips and Tricks

### Pitch black background for Portraits

If you want to make portrait shots with a pitch black background [like this](https://i.imgur.com/rV6DRXz.jpeg), You can use 2 locations that are great for such shots.
The first one is [North of Pitchcliff](https://i.imgur.com/F7cLotQ.png) and the second one is [Dimmed Bones](https://i.imgur.com/6u4jbFZ.jpeg).

### Character swap

You can use [Aloy's Adjustments tool by AkiniKites](https://github.com/AkiniKites/AloysAdjustments) to swap any outfit to be as a different characters\NPC's ingame.

### Additional Notes

When you hotsample to high resolutions (6K and above) Textures will start to switch to lower resolution. You can take a quick shot before that happends or hotsample to a lower resolution to avoid it.

After hotsample, the AO can be glitched out [like this](https://i.imgur.com/jfmEqYv.png). This can be caused when a shot have lots of fog. To get rid of it you can zoom, pan or jiggle the camera.

When you use custom Aspect Ratio, square AR's like 4:3 can give you black bars on top and bottom. Currently there is no way to avoid them in HZD.
