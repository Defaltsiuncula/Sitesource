**Features**: Camera control, FoV control, HUD toggle, timestop, depth blur removal.

**Features**: Allows you to open the dev console using a command

Alternatively you can use ini file changes, like which is done in this mod: [Definite console command mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/batmanarkhamknight/mods/56).
This mod defines a series of keybindings which are then used in-game. If you want to run a certain command in-game you can bind it to a key, using
the same mechanism as described in the Definite console command mod. 

### Tricks

#### Set the number of particles
To increase the number of rain particles in-game, e.g. to create a dramatic effect, you can 
use the following command: `set engine.RRainComponent ParticleCount 999999` 

This must be entered / activated on the 'Continue game' screen. The number `999999` is the number of particles it will use, increasing it to a higher number will 
give you even heavier rain.
