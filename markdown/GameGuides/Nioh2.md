**Features**: Custom aspect ratios or resolutions

@alert important
Sometimes the game freezes when you move the Photo Mode camera forward or backward while the FOV+TILT from the cheat table is enabled (might only happen in certain stages/places). The safe way is disable the fov (can use hotkey) if you want to move forward or backward, then you can enable it when you want to set the fov (without move the Photo Mode camera forward/backward).
@end

### Custom Aspect Ratio
Vertical aspect ratios don't work, but wider AR's do, although the game UI won't be scaled correctly, especially anything wider than 21:9

### Using DSR
In order to use DSR, set the desktop to the resolution you want to use and then you can change to that resolution in-game.
