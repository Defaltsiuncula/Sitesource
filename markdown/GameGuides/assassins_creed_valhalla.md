## Tools

* [Camera tools by Otis_Inf](https://patreon.com/Otis_Inf)  
**[Features](https://opm.fransbouma.com/Cameras/acvalhalla.htm)**: Camera control, FoV control, HUD toggle, timestop/gamespeed, hotsampling

@alert info
The tools also work with the Discovery Tour mode, which can be downloaded separately. Discovery Tour mode also removes enemies and unlocks all parts of the map(s) along with their fast travel locations, which is helpful for environment shots. Some parts of the camera (game pausing) might not work but you can use the photomode to pause the game, then activate the camera.
@end

## Time of Day support

The tools allow ToD changes for Norway and England but it is not possible to change ToD in Jotunheim or Valhalla (the region).

@alert tip
You may get blurry results when trying to use [IGCSDOF](https://opm.fransbouma.com/igcsdof.htm). To fix this, try disabling the game's vanilla antialiasing. You can follow [these steps](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Valhalla#Anti-aliasing_.28AA.29) to do so.
