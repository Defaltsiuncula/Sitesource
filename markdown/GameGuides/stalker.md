#### How to use custom resolutions with the console

To do so run the game in the windowed mode which can be either done via switching in the menu or you type the following line into the console:

`rs_fullscreen 0` and apply the change with the commands `vid_restart`

For custom resolutions:
Setting up the scene in lower resolutions via the following command

`vid_mode [width]x[height]`. For example: `vid_mode 1920x810` for 21:9.
Type in `vid_restart` to apply the resolution

Set up your scene and to the same with a higher resolution. 
For example: `vid_mode 5120x2160`
confirm the resolution with `vid_restart`

#### Enter the Free-Camera

Type `demo_record x` [or whatever you want] in the console AFTER entering one of the prior bound cameras.
This will allow you to fly around.
