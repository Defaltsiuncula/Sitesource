## Depth Buffer fix
You'll notice that the depth buffer might flicker a lot. To prevent this, simply disable Anti-Aliasing in the Options. Recheck selected depth buffer if the issue persists.

@alert tip
Sometimes travelling too far with the freecam breaks a few missions (blocks further progress) so try not to move too far away.
