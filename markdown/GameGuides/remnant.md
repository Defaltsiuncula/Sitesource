**Features**: Pause Game, FOV Control, Hide HUD (read the Readme File for Hotkeys) 

## Tips and Tricks

Useful Console Commands

- `ToggleDebugCamera` : Enables the UE4 free camera
- `TeleportToDebugCamera` : Teleports your character to the current camera location
- `slomo 0.5` / `slomo 1.0` : Slow motion / Normal game speed

The console has a history. Simply press arrow-up to get the list of last entered commands. This allows you to quickly switch between previously entered commands like `ToggleDebugCamera`, `r.PostProcessAAQuality 2` etc. It's advisable to switch off the HUD before enabling the debug camera, as sometimes some HUD elements aren't hidden when the debug camera is enabled.
There's no tilt in the Debug camera in Unreal Engine. Best way to control it is via the keyboard + mouse. Use mouse wheel to control the movement speed, `WASD` for movement and `Q` and `E` to move up/down.
