## Console commands

Since Valve games allow access to the console, no tools are needed.  
Open the console with the `/~ key.  

Command | Arguments| Description
-- | -- | --
`sv_cheats` | `0` / `1` | enables cheats (needed for most of these)
`hidehud` | `0` - `4` | `4` hides HUD
`noclip` | `0` / `1` | toggles noclip (freecam)
`nb_stop` | `0` / `1` | toggles bots & zombie behaviour (timestop)
`r_drawviewmodel` | `0` / `1` | toggles viewmodel (weapon visibility)
`host_timescale` | - | controls gamespeed (multiplier)
`map` | [ID list](https://commands.gg/l4d2/map) | change levels
`give` | [ID list](https://commands.gg/l4d2/give) | spawns weapons
`z_spawn` | [ID list](https://commands.gg/l4d2/z-spawn) | spawns zombies
`cl_glow_survivor_b` | `0` / `1` | toggles survivor outlines
`mat_postprocess_enable` | `0` / `1` | toggles post-processing (bloom, sharpening, LUTs)

`hidehud` does not hide captions and survivor tips, those have to be disabled in the game settings.  

## Tips and Tricks

### Starting a shooting session

Most of these commands only work in a session with cheats enabled. To start one, open the console in the main menu and enter `sv_cheats 1`. Next, start a level of your choice with the `map` command. 

### Binding commands & autoexec.cfg

The above commands can be bound to hotkeys with the use of `bind <key> <command>` / `bindToggle <key> <command>` (latter is best for 0 / 1 commands) so the console doesn't have to be opened all the time. 

These `bind` commands can be written to an `autoexec.cfg` file created in `~\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg` folder. [This guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=381795162) goes into much greater detail regarding console commands and `autoexec.cfg`.

### Lower FOV

There seems to be a hard limit on FOV in-game at 75 deg. It can't be forced lower with commands, but equipping a scoped rifle (or spawning it with `give`) is a handy workaround. Note that you cannot scope in while noclipping.
