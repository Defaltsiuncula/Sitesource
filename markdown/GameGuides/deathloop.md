* [Camera tools by Otis_Inf](https://patreon.com/Otis_Inf)  
**Features**: Unlock Ansel movement through Dishonoured 2 tools.

## Notes
* Dishonoured 2 tools by Otis_Inf can be used to unlock Ansel movement, however no other feature of those tools will work. Pressing Delete whilst tools are active will crash your game.
* Reshade works in game but cannot be used alongside Ansel. You will need to use Freestyle.
* DSR works in game but cannot be used alongside Ansel. (Activating Ansel with DSR active will minimise the game and show Ansel UI over your desktop)
* Ansel Supersampling can be used to create higher resolution shots.
* Sorry AMD users.
