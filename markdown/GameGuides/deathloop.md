## Summary

Feature | Supported
--|--
Vanilla Photo Mode | Yes
Hotsampling | No
DSR | Yes 
Custom Aspect Ratios | No
Reshade | Yes
Ansel | Yes
Graphics API | DirectX 12
Game version | 1.3
 
## Tools

As of the 1.3 update, Deathloop now includes a built-in photomode a with massive camera range, poseable characters and much more. The old method of using Dishonoured 2 tools to unlock Ansel movement now seem likely to crash your game.

@alert tip
To take a higher-resolution screenshot, set up your shot in photomode then activate Ansel to use supersampling.  
You can use Reshade in photo mode then activate Ansel once you have your effects set up, however depending on the shader, this can cause issues whith your final shot after supersampling.
@end

## Notes

DSR works in game but cannot be used alongside Ansel. Activating Ansel with DSR active will simply minimise the game and show the Ansel UI over your desktop. Ansel Supersampling can be used to create higher resolution shots. Sorry AMD users.
