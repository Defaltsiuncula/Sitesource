## Summary

--|--

Hotsampling | Only via Ansel Supersampling
DSR | Yes,  (Can't be used with Ansel)
Custom Aspect Ratios | No
Reshade | Yes
Ansel | Yes

## Tools
As of the 1.3 update, Deathloop now includes a built in photo mode with massive camera range, poseable characters and much more. The old method of using Dishonoured 2 tools to unlock Ansel movement now seem likely to crash your game.

@alert tip
To take a higer resolution screenshot, set up your shot in photo mode then activate Ansel to use supersampling.

You can use Reshade in photo mode then activate Ansel once you have your effects set up, however depending on the shader this can cause issues whith your final shot after supersampling
@end


## Notes

* DSR works in game but cannot be used alongside Ansel. (Activating Ansel with DSR active will minimise the game and show Ansel UI over your desktop)
* Ansel Supersampling can be used to create higher resolution shots.
* Sorry AMD users.
