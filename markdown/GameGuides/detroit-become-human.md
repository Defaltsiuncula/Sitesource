## Audio issues with tool pauses

While pausing the game with the tools, dialogue audio might continue to run for a few characters. In order to resume dialogue properly,

1. Let the dialogue cycle run 
2. Unpause the game with the tools 
3. Pause the game by returning to the pause menu
4. Unpause it one last time. This should fix any errors.

@alert warning
If you move too far away with the freecam, or hotsample frequently, you might start experiencing texture bugs. Restarting a checkpoint might fix the problem. Also, you might experience crashes around "The Nest" mission, so take care while shooting that area.
