## Tools

* [CE Table by Skall](..\CheatTables\thesurge2.ct)  
**Features**:Timestop, Camera Speed, FOV

## Using the CE table and the debug menu to enable free camera

First, you need to add a line to the settings.ini to enable cheats: `cheats_enabled = true`
While in the game, press `RT` + `LR` + `Dpad Right` or `Ctrl-Shift-F12` to open the debug menu, then enable the camera from the menu.
Before entering the debug menu, makes sure to use the CE Table to stop the time etc.

- Timestop: enable and press `Numpad 0` to put the "pTimestop" at 0. It will freeze the time. Then after that you can enter in the debug console.
- Camera Speed: enable and change the value to have a faster camera or a slower one.
- FOV: enable and then press `Numpad +` to increase and `Numpad -` to decrease

## Tips
While in free camera or Timestop, you can go into the menu option to put the Render Scale at 200%. It will increase the quality of the shot.
To capture the game, you can use MSI AfterBurner or GeForce Experience (using ALT+F1)
