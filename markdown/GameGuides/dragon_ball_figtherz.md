## Tips and Tricks

* First of all, if you are not used with Cheat Engine tables, it is really recommended checking the general [CE Guide](https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/cheat_engine_tables.htm).

* Check the DBFZ Mod Manager documentation for instructions on how to set up the aplication;

* For EasyAntiCheat to be really ignored at the time of play, you must run the game with it disabled, to do so, make a desktop shortcut of the game using the executable in the following folder: `\Steam\steamapps\common\DRAGON BALL FighterZ\RED\Binaries\Win64\RED-Win64-Shipping.exe`.

In the shortcut, go to properties, in the target press space after "RED-Win64-Shipping.exe" ends and add -eac-nop-loaded

Play the game using this shortcut and run it with admin rights.

* ReShade and the HUD toggle must be set on this following folder and executable: `\Steam\steamapps\common\DRAGON BALL FighterZ\RED\Binaries\Win64\RED-Win64-Shipping.exe`

* The HUD Toggle only removes the pause menu, but the rest of the HUD elements can be removed via the options menu.
