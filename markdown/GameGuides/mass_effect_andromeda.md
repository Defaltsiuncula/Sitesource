## Custom Aspect Ratios
Vertical aspect ratios don't work, but horizontals do. Also the game doesn't support high definitions like 6k, but you can get some higher definitions in other ARs that aren't 16:9 (the max I could use was 5760x2468).
 
## Tips
- After changing the FOV the game will stop changing it when zooming, in cinematics, etc. To fix that change the "Override FoV" value from -1 to 0 and then back to -1.
- For disabling the games vignette click the big empty box in the tools window and then click the ticked box next to "Enabled".
- Once the Tempest flies for the first time you can no longer use the freecam in it.
- Cutscenes (not the ones that involve common dialogue with NPCs) will crash the game after you unpause, so make sure to save before those.
- The tools controls modify the camera of the game if you are on another window or even trying to interact with the reshade UI. If it's proven difficult to work with, press the "Disable all input" box in the tools window.
