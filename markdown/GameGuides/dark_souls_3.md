## Downgrading to get a working timestop

To get a working timestop we need to downgrade the game's binaries to game version 1.15. Please use the guide on FRAMED to learn how to [Revert Game Update using Steam Console](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/steam_update_guide.htm).
With version 1.15 we can use this [CE Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Dark-Souls-III-CT-TGA/releases/tag/v2.3.2) to get a working timestop under GlobalSpeed. (Strg+f to search for gobalspeed in the table) It's recommended to set hotkeys for the timestop.
