## Tips and Tricks

### Photo Mode

The game has two free camera modes. F5 camera links the camera to the car, F7 camera is unlinked from the car. Both cameras have different controls.

Turn on the app in-game from right side GUI to be able to control FOV, DOF, aspect ratio, shutter speed, change time and sun angle, turn on/off lights, hide driver.

@alert important
Do not use Assetto's built-in camera mode, use CSP Photo Mode app.
@end

Screenshots must be taken in-game with Replay mode.

* Motion screenshots are not possible without Replay mode
* CSP graphic features do not work in AC Showroom

### Free camera controls

Action | F5 Camera | F7 Camera
--|--|--
Move Camera | W, A, S, D | Arrow Keys
Tilt Camera Left/Right | F, G | none
Tilt Camera Up/Down | B, V | none
Up/Down | Z, C | Page Up/Down
Speed | Shift/Tab | Ctrl/Shift
Focus Camera (focus on cursor) | Ctrl + Left Mouse / End Key
Take Shot | F8

### Filter installation

Most Post Processing filters have support for drag & drop installation with Content Manager. For manual installation, go to your game's file directory and drag the files into:

`\assettocorsa\system\cfg\ppfilters`

 Selecting filters is done from the CSP Photo Mode app or the separate Post Process Filter app.

### Game setup

From Content Manager in Assetto Corsa's System settings tick "Allow free camera", untick "Orbit mode for F5 camera", and select PNG in "Screenshots format".

Note: For Sol and CSP installation use their provided guides.

@alert tip
It's highly recommended to have separate gameplay and screenshot setting presets for high FPS and high graphics.
