##Tips and Tricks

### Swap to different aspect ratios\resolutions in-game
As of now, windowed mode is required to change to different aspect ratios and resolutions, and DX11 mode is required 
to change resolutions in windowed mode without crashing the game. 

Steps: 

1. Create the resolutions of your choice.
2. Launch the game.
3. Set the desktop to the resolution you want to use.
4. Change to that resolution in-game. 

### Fix blurry characters in photo mode
The game's TAA causes characters\NPCs to appear blurry in photo mode. In order to fix that and get 
[sharp characters](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7857/47188632762_e4ddc1892d_o.png), use the Cheat Engine speedhack to nearly freeze 
the game (0.01). To make this easy, just set hotkeys (settings -> hotkeys) to various speedhack values. 

* 0.01 to nearly freeze the game
* 1.0 to resume normal gameplay (and control the photo mode)
